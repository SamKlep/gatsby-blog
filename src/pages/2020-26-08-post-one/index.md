Greetings.

Since a lot was explained in the about section, I won't dive too deep into the semantics of this blog. Initially, the idea was to document and keep track of my development as a web developer. See, just one year ago things were much different. I had not yet started down this everlong path of infinite learning, nor did I exactly know that I was about to.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "But Sam, how can you call yourself a developer if a year ago you didn't even know that you wanted to be one?!" And it's true, I did not yet know that was what I was going to be passionate about. Though, that's not to say that I was not already a tech enthusiast or intrigued by it-- because I was. Just not to the degree or from the perspective from which I do or am now.

How did this change come about, one might ask. Well, that was simple. I had a friend who went through a coding bootcamp and recommended it to me. After some research and time to think, I decided that it was something I would really enjoy. As I did have some prior experience working as an old-school webmaster at a company in the early 2000's, and I figured it could be a good way to change careers since I was not happy doing the work I was doing.

Soon enough, the schooling started and I was head deep in new and abstract concepts. Alien new worlds of passing data and looping through arrays, calling APIS and pushing code-- every day was a new concept and a ton of new stresses I had yet known. Fast forward six months later, 3 full-stack projects under my belt and 1 international virus on the loose. The last month was completed entirely on Zoom, which was interesting in iteslf. 

But I did it. I completed my portfolio and recieved my certification. I kept up. I was very proud to say the least. There were days where I literally wanted to give up. Thinking, "There's no way that I'd ever get these advanced concepts down!" But I did, and it was a rush every time I received data back from an API and looped through the results successfully. That feeling kept me going. It showed me the truth, that I can do anything I set my mind to. That abstract phrase from childhood was clear as day now.
