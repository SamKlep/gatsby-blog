        Hello. I'm Sam. Yes, I do like green eggs & ham-- among other things.
        Such as coding, space, music, art, simplistic design, my rottweiler,
        etc. The list goes on and on. Since the list goes on and on, why not
        document it?

        With the way things have been lately, I feel any little bit of
        positivity goes a long way. Now it can be said that the act of blogging
        alone is self-centered and inner-directed. Which is indeed true. But one
        could also argue that real change starts at the individual level, which
        is magnified as a chain-effect intertwining all who directly and
        indirectly come into contact with you. So this little corner of the
        internet is dedicated to all-things-interesting and deemed worthy of a
        second glance. There will be a mix between my personal learning and
        progress as a programmer, but also as a human being being tossed in the
        mix of 21st century pandemonium.
